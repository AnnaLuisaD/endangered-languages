Endangered Languages
====================

There is no centralised list of open-source code that would be useful for documenting, conserving, developing, preserving, or working with endangered languages. According to some estimates, half of the 7,000~ currently spoken languages are expected to become extinct this century ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_preservation)). However, there is a lot of work by academics, independant scholars, organizations, communities, and individuals that may be of use in helping to stop this. This list is intended to provide a central location to document those efforts. 

Please **submit pull requests** if you know of any resource available that is not on this list, either on Github or not, either code or otherwise. To edit this list, simply [click here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/endangered-languages/edit/master/README.md).

**Endangered languages** are human languages that are in danger of extinction. This list also encompasses minority languages - languages which are spoken by a stable, but small, population (for example, Maltese or Hawai'ian); and low- or under-resourced languages, which are spoken by a significant population but under-represented on the web (for instance, Quechua). These languages share certain characteristics in common; the most pertinent is sparse data and a lack of resources, ranging from spell-checkers to grammars to machine translation corpora. Other under-resourced languages that do not fall under this list include constructed languages (for instance, Klingon or Na'vi), computer languages (for instance, Javascript or Lua), and extinct languages that are so sparse as to be rendered computationally irrelevant for most purposes (for instance, Tocharian).
